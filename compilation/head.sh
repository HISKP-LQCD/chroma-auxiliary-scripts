# Installs USQCD Chroma on with QPhiX on selected Intel-based supercomputers.
#
# This script will download the needed sources, configure, compile, and install
# them. After the script ran through, you will have a working installation of
# Chroma with QPhiX acceleration.
#
# If the machine of your interest is not support by this script, it should be
# fairly straightforward to add it. In the various `case` statements you need
# to add another block. The names of the module system will probably have to be
# adapted as well. In case you need to compile additional dependencies, it
# would sense to make this a conditional on the `$host` variable as well.
