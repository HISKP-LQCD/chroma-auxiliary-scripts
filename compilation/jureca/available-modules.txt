  TotalView: TotalView/2016T.07.11-beta, TotalView/2016.06.21
    TotalView breaks down barriers to understanding what's going on with
    your high-performance computing (HPC) and supercomputing applications.
    Purpose-built for multicore and parallel computing, TotalView provides
    a set of tools providing unprecedented control over processes and
    thread execution, along with deep visibility into program states and
    data. By allowing the simultaneous debugging of many processes and
    threads in a single window, you get complete control over program
    execution: running, stepping, and halting line-by-line through code
    within a single thread or within arbitrary groups of processes or
    threads. You can also work backwards from failure through reverse
    debugging, isolating the root cause faster by eliminating the need to
    repeatedly restart the application, reproduce and troubleshoot
    difficult problems that can occur in concurrent programs that take
    advantage of threads, OpenMP, MPI, GPUs, or coprocessors. With
    customizable displays of the state of your running program, memory
    leaks, deadlocks, and race conditions are things of the past. Whether
    you're a scientific and technical computing veteran, or new to the
    development challenges of multicore or parallel applications, TotalView
    gives you the insight to find and correct errors quickly, validate
    prototypes early, verify calculations accurately, and above all,
    certify code correctly. TotalView works with C, C++, and Fortran
    applications written for Linux (including the Cray and Blue Gene
    platforms), UNIX, Mac OS X, and Xeon Phi coprocessor, and supports
    OpenMP, MPI, and OpenACC / CUDA. Contact: sc@fz-juelich.de - Homepage:

  darshan-runtime: darshan-runtime/3.1.1
    Darshan is designed to capture an accurate picture of application I/O
    behavior, including properties such as patterns of access within files,
    with minimum overhead. The name is taken from a Sanskrit word for
    ‚Äúsight‚Äù or ‚Äúvision‚Äù. Darshan can be used to investigate and
    tune the I/O behavior of complex HPC applications. In addition,
    Darshan‚Äôs lightweight design makes it suitable for full time
    deployment for workload characterization of large systems. We hope that
    such studies will help the storage research community to better serve
    the needs of scientific computing. Darshan was originally developed on
    the IBM Blue Gene series of computers deployed at the Argonne
    Leadership Computing Facility, but it is portable across a wide variety
    of platforms include the Cray XE6, Cray XC30, and Linux clusters.
    Darshan routinely instruments jobs using up to 786,432 compute cores on
    the Mira system at ALCF. Usage (darshan-runtime): Export the
    environment variable DARSHAN_LOG_PATH to where the logging data should
    be written, e.g. LD_PRELOAD=$EBROOTDARSHANMINRUNTIME/lib/libdarshan.so
    DARSHAN_LOG_PATH=/path/to/your/logdir srun -n 32 ./executable Usage
    (darshan-util): The result is a darshan log file which can be converted
    using darshan-job-summary.pl /path/to/your/logdir/mylog.darshan.gz
    Note: Darshan currently only works with C or C++ codes, not with
    Fortran. Contact: Kay Thust (k.thust@fz-juelich.de) - Homepage:
